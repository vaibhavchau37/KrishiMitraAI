# Regional Classification Fix ✅

## 🚨 Issue Found
Mumbai (PIN: 400001) was incorrectly classified as **South India** instead of **West India**, causing wrong crop recommendations.

## 🔧 Root Cause
The pincode range classification was incorrect:
```
❌ WRONG:
- North India: 000001-199999 ✓ (correct)
- West India: 200000-399999 ❌ (missed 400xxx range)  
- South India: 400000-599999 ❌ (started too early)
- East India: 600000+ ❌ (started too early)
```

## ✅ Fixed Classification
```
✅ CORRECT:
- North India: 000001-199999 
- West India: 200000-499999 (now includes 400xxx)
- South India: 500000-699999 (proper range)
- East India: 700000+ (proper range)
```

## 📍 Regional Examples Now Working Correctly

| Pincode | City | Region | Top Recommendation | Why It's Perfect |
|---------|------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| 110001 | Delhi | North India | **Maize** | High yield cereal for North |
| 400001 | Mumbai | West India | **Cotton** | Major cash crop of West India |
| 560001 | Bangalore | South India | **Coffee** | Karnataka is coffee capital |
| 700001 | Kolkata | East India | **Rice** | Bengal's staple crop |

- **Dataset-driven recommendations** remain accurate
